# Web Infrastructure Design

This project contains web infrastructure designs for different scenarios, from simple single-server setups to distributed, secured, and monitored architectures.

## Tasks

### 0. Simple Web Stack
- **File**: `0x09-web_infrastructure_design/0-simple_web_stack`
- **Description**: One server web infrastructure with LAMP stack
- **Components**: 1 server, Nginx, application server, MySQL, domain configuration

### 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure
- **File**: `0x09-web_infrastructure_design/1-distributed_web_infrastructure`
- **Description**: Three server web infrastructure with load balancing
- **Components**: 3 servers, Nginx, HAproxy, application server, MySQL Primary-Replica

### 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
- **File**: `0x09-web_infrastructure_design/2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure`
- **Description**: Three server web infrastructure with security and monitoring
- **Components**: 3 servers, firewalls, SSL/HTTPS, monitoring clients, load balancing

## Requirements

- Each task requires whiteboarding the infrastructure design
- Screenshots of completed whiteboard diagrams must be uploaded to an image hosting service
- Links to screenshots should be inserted into the respective answer files
- Whiteboarding sessions will be conducted with mentors/staff (30 minutes, no notes)
- Focus on requirements without unnecessary details

## Learning Objectives

- Understand web infrastructure components and their roles
- Design scalable and reliable web architectures
- Implement security and monitoring best practices
- Explain infrastructure decisions and trade-offs
- Practice technical communication and whiteboarding skills
